## 💡 Core Messages

### The Problem: Vibe Coding
Ad-hoc AI prompting leads to:
- 4x increase in code duplication
- Unpredictable code quality
- Complexity pushed to debugging/testing
- Unsustainable design patterns

### The Solution: Spec-Driven Development
Formal specifications enable:
- **30-50%** reduction in development time
- **60%** decrease in specification-related bugs
- **40%** improvement in code maintainability
- **25%** faster onboarding for new developers

## 📊 Key Metrics Highlighted

```
30-50% - Reduction in overall development time
60%    - Decrease in specification-related bugs
40%    - Improvement in long-term code maintainability
25%    - Faster onboarding for new developers
41%    - Of all code is now AI-generated
76%    - Of developers use or plan to use AI coding tools
```
