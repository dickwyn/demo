## prompting

```
"hey, build me a social photo sharing app.

## spec kit

**constitution first:**
```
/constitution Security-first, WCAG compliant,
React + TypeScript, comprehensive testing
```

**then systematic workflow:**
```
/specify   → detailed user stories
/clarify.  → clarify underspecified areas
/plan      → technical architecture  
/tasks     → implementation roadmap
/implement → production-ready code
```

**result:** 🎯 predictable, maintainable, documented software
