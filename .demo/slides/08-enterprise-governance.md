# Enterprise Governance
## Baking Standards into the AI Workflow

### 📖 The Constitution

`constitution.md` - Repository for your project's **"non-negotiable principles"**

### ⚖️ Codify Your Rules

- **Testing:** "All features must have unit tests"
- **Security:** "All API inputs must be validated"  
- **Tech Stack:** "All frontend uses React and TypeScript"
- **Accessibility:** "All UI must meet WCAG 2.1 AA"

### 🛡️ From Risk to Enforcer

AI consults the constitution during `/plan` phase

Transforms AI from potential deviation risk → **Active enforcer of your standards**
