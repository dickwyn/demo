# the problem with current AI coding

### ðŸ¤– AI is everywhere, but...

- unstructured, ad-hoc prompting of AI coding assistants (e.g., "develop feature X that does Y")
- AI agents lose track of past decisions, forcing us to repeat instructions
- architectural decisions are trapped in chat logs or memory, leading to inconsistent code
- variety of assumptions are made. security model? data storage? error handling?
- that all leads to more time debugging and fixing misaligned assumptions than actually planning
