# Traditional AI vs Spec Kit

## ❌ "Vibe Coding"

```
"Hey, build me a social photo sharing app.
Users should be able to upload photos, 
organize them into albums, and share with 
friends. Make it modern and responsive.
Oh, and add some AI features for tagging."
```

**The model makes dozens of assumptions:**
- Authentication method?
- File storage solution?
- API design?
- Scaling requirements?

**Result:** ⚠️ Code that works... sometimes

## ✅ Structured Approach

**Constitution first:**
```
/constitution Security-first, WCAG compliant,
React + TypeScript, comprehensive testing
```

**Then systematic workflow:**
```
/specify   → Detailed user stories
/plan      → Technical architecture  
/tasks     → Implementation roadmap
/implement → Production-ready code
```

**Result:** 🎯 Predictable, maintainable, documented software
