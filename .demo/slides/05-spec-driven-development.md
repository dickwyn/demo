# What is Spec-Driven Development?

### ðŸ”„ Flipping the Script

**Traditional:** Code first, document later (if ever)

**Spec-Driven:** Specifications become **executable** and directly generate implementations

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Principles

- **Intent-driven** - Define the "what" before the "how"
- **Multi-step refinement** - No more one-shot prompts
- **Guardrails** - Organizational principles guide AI
- **Version-controlled** - Specs, plans, and tasks are tracked

### ðŸ’¡ The Result

**Specifications aren't scaffolding to discardâ€”they're the source of truth that drives working code**
