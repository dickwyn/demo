# The Problem with "Vibe Coding"
## Unstructured Prompts = Unpredictable Results

### 🎯 What is "Vibe Coding"?

Using **ad-hoc, conversational prompts** to guide AI assistants

### ❌ Why It Fails

LLMs are powerful pattern-matchers, but they **can't read minds**

### 📝 Example: "add photo sharing to my app"

Forces the AI to make **thousands of unstated assumptions**:

- User roles & permissions • Data models & storage
- Security & privacy • Error handling & validation

### ⚠️ The Result

Code that might compile, but is often **buggy**, **misaligned**, and **hard to maintain**
